<div class="admonition aside"><p class="admonition-title">Preface</p><p><br><br></p>
<p><em>It’s been a little over a year since my last post which may lead one to wonder if I had dropped off the face of the earth or merely given up.  Fortunately neither is even close to being true.</em></p>
<br>

<p><em>Unless you’re a Sleeping Beauty or Rip Van Winkle, you will have noticed 2020 was the year of COVID-19.  We’ve been</em> extremely fortunate <em>here in Australia; we locked down early enough to eradicate most of the community spread.  We’ve suffered only a little over 900 deaths so far which is in stark contrast to most other nations and the total world death count of over 2,887,000 people (figures correct at time of writing).</em></p>
<br>

<p><em>While Australians were virtually unaffected by the virus itself we were heavily affected in other ways.  Firstly, lockdowns played havoc to our supply chains.  Western Australia is the most isolated capital city in the world, and our supermarkets moved quickly to curb panic-buying by enforcing restrictions.  It worked eventually, but not before our supermarkets were stripped bare by fear-driven mobs before the restrictions could be put in place.  The lack of supply played havoc for my family, especially due to our soy- and rice-milk drinking ways (which were classified as “long-life milk” and restricted).  I would spend hours travelling across multiple neighborhoods each day, going shop to shop to gather enough food and supplies for our daily meals.  Fortunately we had no problems with toilet paper, which seemed to be a problem for many people.</em> 🧻</p>
<br>

<p><em>My partner and I removed our kids from school early over health concerns, and a week later the government sent children home en masse.  Online learning was organised, but overworked teachers don’t have time to keep up with technology let alone move their entire syllabus to it, so the quality was unusable.  We couldn’t keep up with our kids questions about the incomprehensible instructions they were given while holding down our full time remote jobs.  The constant attention required to make it work was too demanding of our time and we were forced to abandon our children’s education altogether during this remainder of lockdown.</em></p>
<br>

<p><em>As most of Australia came out of lockdown and life found the new normal for most folks, my partner began suffering a debilitating medical issue and couldn’t get out of bed or move at all on her own.  I took up the additional responsibility of full-time carer for our children and for her.  Our public hospital system failed her utterly, refusing to provide a bed, adequate medical relief, or empathy from the agonising pain that wracked her body around the clock.  After weeks of broken sleep, mental anguish, and helplessness at being unable to relieve her constant cries of pain, we threw a haymaker and went to a private hospital.  Thankfully she</em> immediately <em>started getting the right treatment at last, putting her on track for multiple back surgeries to repair what turned out to be the worst bulging disc in anyone’s peacetime experience. She is still recovering but is finally doing okay.</em></p>
<br>

<p><em>During this period of caring for her, being a sole-parent, working full-time, and hour-long round-trips to the hospital far far away, my mental health started to break.  Now anyone who’s played cricket with or against me knows I am one mentally tough hombre, but after months of my unrelenting pressure my grey-matter said “no”.  As luck would have it I had already organised a therapist for myself weeks earlier and right at my breaking point I had the help I needed on hand.</em></p>
<br>

<p><em>As a bonus we determined I suffer from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/complex-ptsd">CPTSD</a> caused by major childhood trauma.  This was actually a huge relief to me; it explained many life-long issues and forced me to direct some care on myself for a change.  Sure it meant living with the COVID-shitstorm of the present and unearthing unholy childhood trauma simultaneously, but y’all know I relish a challenge. At the end of this I’m going to be one goddamn unstoppable force of nature.</em></p>
<br>

<p><em>My partner appears to be recovering at long last, and I look forward to the day she’s fully recovered.  It’s been a long hard road for both of us.  Our kids have been resilient throughout this whole reign of fire and I believe its a testament to our amazing parenting skills.</em></p>
<br>

<p><em>Now my life is getting back on track I’ve been reclaiming some spare time and dipping my toes into side projects once again.  I thought I was starting gently, but as you’ll see the adventures just keep coming for me.</em> 😁</p>
<br>

<p><em>I look forward to my partner’s full recovery, the COVID vaccine to roll out and be a success</em> 🤞 <em>, and to my recovery from a lifetime of undiagnosed mental trauma.</em></p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Computer programmers, software engineers, software developers; no matter what we call ourselves, there are times where all of us find ourselves faced with some logic we know is a solved problem and reach out on the internet for the solution.  Most of the time that solution can be found by spending a few minutes on our favourite search engine.  We quickly gain knowledge of how the solution works, most often with code to help us understand the explanation.  We take the code offered, tinker with it to make it our own, and move on having learned something.</p>
<p>This was <em>not</em> the case for me recently when it came time to work with algorithms I needed for what mathematicians call k-combinations.  While I quickly found information about the <em>mathematics</em> of k-combinations, I found precious little about converting that mathematics in to code.</p>
<p>Having spent <em>weeks</em> of spare time working on a problem that I expected would only take a few minutes, and with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ZodmanPerth/status/1361973074652848132?s=20">encouragement from fellow engineers</a>,  I realised there was a hole in our online knowledge base about this important topic.  This post attempts to fill that void.</p>
<h1 id="How-it-Started"><a href="#How-it-Started" class="headerlink" title="How it Started"></a>How it Started</h1><p>25 years ago I wrote an application in Microsoft Excel to help me pick numbers for the national lottery.  In the mid 90’s when I wrote this app, the biggest (and only) lottery available in my  hometown city of Perth (Western Australia) was the Saturday Lottery Draw.  In this lottery, every game required you to pick 6 numbers from 45 numbers, and you could play as many games as you like every week for an increasing amount of cost.</p>
<p>Like any gambler worth their salt, I have my own superstitions when it comes to the selection of my numbers.  Here are mine:</p>

<li>Make sure you play every number in the field at least once, across a minimal number of games</li>
<li>If you don’t win any prize in the weekly draw, replay the same numbers the following week</li>
<li>If you <em>do</em> win any prize in the weekly draw, regenerate a new set of numbers to play</li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t have to be a math genius to realise that to satisfy #1 you need to play a minimum of 45 ÷ 6 = 7.5 games.  I chose to play 12 games every week, so I could cover the field once, take the three numbers left over from game 8 with the left over from game 8 in a second field, and fill 4 more games with randomly selected games from that second field.</p>
<p>This was fairly simple to achieve with Excel VBA.  I wrote two columns of numbers from 1 to 45 (the two fields), shuffled the columns using VBA’s random number generator, then coloured each group of 6 (each game) with different colours.  I manually transfer my picks onto paper coupons and play them each week.</p>
<p><img src="excel-lotto-selector.png" alt="2 columns, 8 colours, 1 button - we're gonna be rich!"></p>
<p>25 years later I’m still waiting for that big win.  The gambler’s conspiracy voice in my head has been at me for decades to change my approach.  Being a vastly more seasoned programmer today than I was when I wrote that app, one day I decided to indulge my inner gambler and rewrite the app using my current technology stack (C# with a UWP front end).  You know, purely for scientific purposes 🤨.  It wouldn’t take long, right? 🤦‍♀️</p>
<h1 id="New-Superstitions"><a href="#New-Superstitions" class="headerlink" title="New Superstitions"></a>New Superstitions</h1><p>Software engineers are very good at identifying patterns, and I am quite exceptional at it.  After decades of using my Excel App I’ve noticed what appears to be the same groups of numbers appearing over and over.  The scientist in me theorises the 25+ year old VBA randomizer probably doesn’t have the <em>best</em> random distribution on the planet, so I wondered if the .NET randomizer would be any better.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard to whip up some code in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linqpad.net/">LinqPad</a> to show the distribution, and sure enough it was terrible.  I toyed with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.rngcryptoserviceprovider">.NET Cryptogrphic Number Generator</a> and was equally dissatisfied.  I searched NuGet for a better alternative, and settled on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://randn.dev/">RandN</a> which has a specific aim to improve the quality of the randomness.  Testing the distribution of the various generators RandN provides also left me dissatisfied.  Here’s a sample distribution over <span style="color: #06a555;"><em>100 million</em></span> generations of numbers between 1 and 45 using it’s <code>StandardRng</code> strategy:</p>
<p><img src="randn-distribution.png" alt="Not the flattest of random distributions"></p>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">note</p><p>While not lighting my world on fire with it’s random distribution, I do find RandN to be a solid random number generator.  I continue using it to provide random numbers for this project and recommend it over .NET’s built in randomizers.</p>
</div>

<p>After some experimentation with generating lotto games randomly, and noticing certain combinations repeating too often for my liking, I resigned myself to the fact that simply using a random number generator was not going to be enough to satisfy my inner conspiracist.  I would need to do more work to guarantee I don’t play the same numbers more than once.</p>
<p>It should be obvious there will be a finite number of ways to choose 6 numbers from 45 numbers.  I figured if I precalculate every possible combination of 6, select my games randomly from this list, and store the combinations I have played, then I can guarantee I won’t be repeating games until I have depleted the entire list.  I need to do additional work to ensure I don’t choose combinations that violate superstition #1 above, but that’s the kind of algorithmic challenge that I love about writing code; I have faith in myself to resolve that.</p>
<p>I just need to generate that list right?</p>
<h1 id="Another-Numbers-Game"><a href="#Another-Numbers-Game" class="headerlink" title="Another Numbers Game"></a>Another Numbers Game</h1><p>To track the games I’ve played I would be storing a large list of sequences of 6 numbers on disk, so I need to consider how much space that takes.  The worst case with minimal decoration will store all combinations of 45 choose 6, so how many combinations are there?</p>
<p>Mathematics has a field of study called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics">Combinatorics</a> that is devoted to counting systems of finite and infinite sets of numbers.  It doesn’t take much searching to discover that in the language of mathematics I’m asking the question “how many combinations are there of <em>n choose k</em>?”.  This is a solved problem in mathematics; the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_k-combinations">number of k-combinations</a> is the count of the finite set of unique ways to choose <em>k combinations</em> from <em>n</em> things.  From there it’s easy to find the formula for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">Binomial Coefficient</a> which is used to calculate the count of <em>n choose k</em>.</p>

<p><span class="caption">How mathematics write <em>n choose k</em></span></p>
<p>I won’t go into the math just yet, but using this formula I found the number of combinations I would need to store is <span style="color: #06a555;">8,145,060</span>.  That’s a big number!  If I store all 6 numbers of each combination as a 12 digit string with no separator, this results in a file size of over 85MB!  That’s an excessive amount of data for someone who grew up in the 8 bit era, and I simply couldn’t find peace until I found a better storage mechanism.</p>
<h1 id="Can-You-Smell-What-The-Math-Is-Cooking"><a href="#Can-You-Smell-What-The-Math-Is-Cooking" class="headerlink" title="Can You Smell What The Math Is Cooking?"></a>Can You Smell What The Math Is Cooking?</h1><p>One tool computer scientists use to identify entries in a consistently repeatable sequence of data (such as my list of all possible sequences) is an <em>index</em>.  I can just number each entry in my list of all possible games with an integer from 1 to 8,145,060 as long as I can generate the same sequence every time I need.  If I store each index on it’s own line in the file, that gives me a maximum file size of just under 69MB.  While that is an improvement over 85MB (almost 20% less data), there are more efficient ways to store index data than as ASCII.  What’s important to realise though is that indexing is probably my best way to reference previously played combinations.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_number_system">Combinatorial Number Systems</a>, mathematics has us covered there too.

<h1 id="Where’s-Wally"><a href="#Where’s-Wally" class="headerlink" title="Where’s Wally?"></a>Where’s Wally?</h1><p>Knowing what the mathematical terms are is one thing, but finding examples of algorithms implementing them is something else.  For programmers, the most helpful <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3143197/117797">Stack Overflow contributions</a> on the topic often refer to an old MSDN article that has been retired, and currently available only by downloading a massive PDF archive of MSDN that includes it.  For mathematicians, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1227692/469429">community contributions</a> gloss over much of the reasoning that programmers need to create algorithms.  I suppose in that respect at least the programming and mathematical communities have that in common. 😜</p>
<p>After a lot of searching I concluded that finding algorithms for rank and unrank weren’t available to read, understand, and use like most solved problems generally are.  In terms of a complete reference of how to think about those mathematical functions, the best example I could find was definitely that retired MSDN article by Dr James McCaffrey, which I’ve dug out and am <a href="/2021/04/10/software-algorithms-for-k-combinations/Generating-the-mth-Lexicographical-Element-of-a-Mathematical-Combination-Dr-James-McCaffrey.pdf">now hosting</a> for posterity and your reading pleasure.</p>
<p>Armed with Dr McCaffrey’s article in particular, and supported by a host of other mathematical and Wikipedia web pages, I began to decode, reproduce, and create the functions I needed in C#.</p>
<h1 id="Algorithm-Archaeology"><a href="#Algorithm-Archaeology" class="headerlink" title="Algorithm Archaeology"></a>Algorithm Archaeology</h1><p>The article describes the algorithm for <em>unranking</em> a k-combination from it’s index, as well as providing some C# code to do it.  While the code is welcome and helps to verify the intention of the lengthy description, the description itself is the gold I needed to find in order to resurrect the knowledge.  As for the code, I most often I prefer to re-write code myself to embed the knowledge in my own mind and incorporate language features that didn’t exist when reference code was written (simplifying it for maintainability and unit testing).  Further, the reference code uses a zero-based system whereas the solution I’m after requires a one-based system.</p>
<p>After a lot of sweat and experimenting, I managed to distill the algorithm for a one-based unrank function down to the pseudocode below.  The steps required in the algorithm are on the left, while some example working out using the set <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: -0.566ex"

<p>Now lets consider a <em>combinatorial number system</em>.  In a combinatorial number system we can represent any number by breaking it down into unit columns just like the decimal and binary systems.  However instead of representing each unit column as a power of some base integer, we’ll use <em>binomial coefficients</em>.</p>

<h1 id="Algorithm-for-Unrank"><a href="#Algorithm-for-Unrank" class="headerlink" title="Algorithm for Unrank"></a>Algorithm for Unrank</h1><p>Now that we’ve discussed the theory and defined the terms, lets return to the pseudocode of the unrank function:</p>
<figure class="highlight text"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Take n and k                     |  n = 5, k = 3,  (n choose k) = 10</span><br><span class="line">Take the index we want           |  1</span><br><span class="line">Move to base 0                   |  index - 1                   = 0</span><br><span class="line">Calculate the dual               |  (n choose k) - 1 - index    = 10 - 1 - 0    = 9</span><br><span class="line">Calculate combinadic of the dual |  combinadic of dual          = combinadic(9) = (4,3,2)</span><br><span class="line">Map to zero-based combination    |  (n-1) - combinadic elements = 4 - (4,3,2)   = (0,1,2)</span><br><span class="line">Add 1 (for base 1)               |  (1,2,3)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Things should make complete sense now.  The only thing to note is how I convert my index from one-based to zero-based so I can use Dr. McCaffrey’s Unrank theory (which is zero-based), and then convert the result from zero-based back to one-based at the end for my one-based lottery generator.</p>
<p>It was relatively simple to code this up in C#.</p>

Surely the information I needed was right alongside the theory for <em>unrank</em>, right?</p>
<p>My excitement quickly faded when I discovered Dr McCaffrey’s article stopped short of discussing the rank function.  Panic started to set in when I couldn’t find any code or discussion of how the Rank function works anywhere on the web.  It’s as though the problem was so well understood that nobody bothered to document it.  I went from having the buzz that comes with success after weeks of hard work to the dread of having to do it all again to create the second, missing algorithm.</p>
<p>Fortunately by this point my senses for Mathematics and Science were completely re-awakened and I remembered that rank and unrank are bijections. That means I should be able to reverse the algorithm for <em>unrank</em> to find the algorithm for <em>rank</em>.</p>
<p>One more time, here’s the pseudocode for <em>unrank</em>:</p>

<p>If I was going to refactor for more performance I should write some performance tests to measure the change in execution speed for the original and refactored functions.  It was time to bust out my old friend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benchmarkdotnet.org/">BenchmarkDotNet</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following my blog you may remember this old friend from my <a href="/2017/12/10/measuring-csharp-perf-with-benchmarkdotnet/">first blog post</a> back in 2017.  In the years since BenchmarkDotNet has gone from strength to strength and is now the most widely used performance measuring tool in history. Microsoft use it extensively, for example, to prevent performance regression and drive performance improvements out of the unified .NET platform.  The benefits of that effort have resulted in some amazing performance gains, to the point where C# is <em>faster</em> than C++ in many aspects.  That’s an incredible outcome.</p>
<p>Last time I used BenchmarkDotNet I stayed within the confounds of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a>.  This time I already had my lottery generator app already up and running somewhat in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a> so it made sense to continue using it there.  I refactored my Rank and Unrank algorithms into a <code>CombinatorialNumberSystem</code> class for consumption, which had the added benefit of simplifying how I handle values of <code>n</code> and <code>k</code>, and allowing the up-front calculation of write-once variables such as the <code>dualOfZero</code>.</p>
<p>Next I created a new <code>FastCombinatorialNumberSystem</code> class that removed that second <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: -0.025ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.179ex" height="1.595ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -694 521 705"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="matrix(1 0 0 -1 0 0)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mi"><path data-c="1D458" d="M121 647Q121 657 125 670T137 683Q138 683 209 688T282 694Q294 694 294 686Q294 679 244 477Q194 279 194 272Q213 282 223 291Q247 309 292 354T362 415Q402 442 438 442Q468 442 485 423T503 369Q503 344 496 327T477 302T456 291T438 288Q418 288 406 299T394 328Q394 353 410 369T442 390L458 393Q446 405 434 405H430Q398 402 367 380T294 316T228 255Q230 254 243 252T267 246T293 238T320 224T342 206T359 180T365 147Q365 130 360 106T354 66Q354 26 381 26Q429 26 459 145Q461 153 479 153H483Q499 153 499 144Q499 139 496 130Q455 -11 378 -11Q333 -11 305 15T277 90Q277 108 280 121T283 145Q283 167 269 183T234 206T200 217T182 220H180Q168 178 159 139T145 81T136 44T129 20T122 7T111 -2Q98 -11 83 -11Q66 -11 57 -1T48 16Q48 26 85 176T158 471L195 616Q196 629 188 632T149 637H144Q134 637 131 637T124 640T121 647Z"></path></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> loop and reduced the mathematics of rebasing between zero to one, effectively merging a few pseudocode steps together.

For Rank, the vanilla <code>CombinatorialNumberSystem</code> averaged less than 54 nanoseconds to compete each calculation, but the <code>FastCombinatorialNumberSystem</code> was 43% faster on average and took less than half the memory.  What a great payoff for just a little bit of refactoring!</p>
<p>The results for Unrank, on the other hand, were even more surprising:</p>

Perhaps the magicians of compilation-time code optimisation did the work for me and came up with essentially the same code as my refactored version.  This demonstrates the value of measuring your code for <em>actual</em> performance gains because here I was <em>perceiving</em> and <em>expecting</em> a big boost when there wasn’t any.</p>

<p>Don’t forget I’m also hosting Dr McCaffrey’s original MSDN article (due to it disappearing off the web with MSDN being shut down).  The link for that is also below:</p>
